#### **About**

As a core component of my master’s program, I completed a capstone project demonstrating my statistical and data analysis skills. For this project, I developed an independent research question, explored a new multi-institutional data source, and implemented statistical methods in a fully programmable workflow. Working with Electronic Medical Records (EMR) from several participating institutions, I focused heavily on data integrity: looking at variables, assessing data quality, and understanding how site-level differences could influence our dataset. This was a [SAS](sas.com)-first project, and over its course I became comfortable building and debugging complex SAS scripts for large-scale clinical data. The written capstone was prepared in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), which also allowed me to deepen my proficiency in scientific writing and document preparation.

I joined this project under the mentorship of Dr. Sparapani, after a collaborator in Pediatric Hematology approached to study disparities among children with sickle cell disease. Together, we identified the TriNetX (now [Truveta](https://www.truveta.com/)) platform as a way to access multi-site EMR data and answer our questions at scale. My work on this collaboration ultimately led me to formulate my own capstone research question, using the same data to investigate pediatric disparities in a way that reflected my specific interests in health equity and applied biostatistics.
