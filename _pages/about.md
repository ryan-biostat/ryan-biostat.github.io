Hello! **Welcome** to my academic homepage, where you can learn more about my background, projects, research interests, and contributions in biostatistics and bioinformatics.

I am currently a Biostatistician in Dr. Ulrich Broeckel’s Advanced Genomics Lab at the Medical College of Wisconsin / Children’s Wisconsin. Our work focuses on identifying rare, disease-causing structural variants in the human genome using Oxford Nanopore Long-Read Sequencing (LRS) and Bionano Optical Genome Mapping (OGM). My role involves processing, annotating, and analyzing human genomes (typically from undiagnosed patient samples) for rare variant discovery. I also handle RNA-seq data for knockdown experiments and oversee the statistical analyses that support instrument performance reporting in our CAP-accredited clinical laboratory.

My research interests center on discovering rare, disease-causing variants through modern statistical and computational techniques. I believe the growing availability of high-quality sequencing data from platforms such as LRS and OGM will enable more accurate disease–variant associations and ultimately support improved clinical decision-making.
